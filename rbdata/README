This data is the training/testing data for the RedBlue project.

It consists of .txt files that are the transcripts from the democratic and republican primary debates in early spring of 2016.

The transcripts themselves need to be updated to be inclusive of the April debates.

Operational phase: Once we get the model working, we'll need to ingest RSS feeds from news sources.
